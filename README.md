Hydrologycal drought analysis
Hydrological drougts refers to shortages of water resources, when for example; groundwater, reservoir, or stream levels are significantly reduced.
A modern definition of drought proposes definitions that more explicitly distinguish different aspects of the ‘hazard’
A meteorological drought (hazard) is defined as: a temporary, negative and severe deviation from the average
precipitation values for a significant period of time across a river basin or region.
A blue-water drought (hazard) is defined here as: an unusual and significant deficiency of groundwater, stream
flow, or lake storage.
A green-water drought (hazard) is defined here as: an unusual and significant deficiency in water stored in or on
top of the soil or vegetation.
